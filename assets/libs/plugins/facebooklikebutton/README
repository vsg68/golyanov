Extract this to assets/libs/plugins/facebooklikebutton/

If you need to change any settings, you can edit the template file:
assets/libs/plugins/facebooklikebutton/e2g.facebooklikebutton.tpl

You need to add the plugin into the database:
    1. Menu > Plugins > Add tab >

    2. Fill these up:
        Name: facebooklikebutton
        Description : Facebook Like Button
        Plugin disabled : Check (unless you want to enable this as the default, uncheck this)
        Index file : assets/libs/plugins/facebooklikebutton/index.php
        System Events : check "OnE2GWebThumbRender (thumb:pluginName#render)"

    3. SAVE.

If this plugin is not enabled by default, call this with snippet (again, snippet call overrides the disabled plugin setting):
[!easy2? &gid=`9,10` &plugin=`thumb:facebooklikebutton#render`!]
